# Dylan's Gatsby/Contentful Blog

### Description

A simple [blog](https://girard-blog.netlify.app/) using Gatsby.js as a frontend, and the Contentful CMS as a dynamic backend. All queries use the Gatsby GraphQL API.

Styling is written in SCSS, and the site is deployed on Netlify. The contact page uses a Netlify integration to collect user messages submitted with the Contact Form component, which are then forwarded to my email address.

### Credits

This blog was built in large part thanks to the incredible tutorial by Andrew Mead, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM).
