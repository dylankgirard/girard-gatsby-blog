      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Dylan - a software developer from Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>
        I was raised in Bend, Oregon, and spent most of my life training, performing, and teaching as a
        classical trumpet player. I've played music all over the world, and
        it's always been a very important part of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love creating beautifully crafted web applications that make the user
        feel at ease. I also have a strong interest in QA and the testing
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
